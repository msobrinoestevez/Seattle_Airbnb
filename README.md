## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data from 2016 and 2017 to better understand:

1. When is the best time of the year to visit Seattle in terms of availability and pricing?
2. Do prices and availability change depending the weekday?
3. Where are the best locations to book a place through Airbnb?
4. Can we use listing information to predict the housing price?
5. Which variables impact the most to price?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@m.sobrino.estevez/planning-a-trip-to-seattle-to-reduce-your-90s-grunge-nostalgia-find-out-your-best-airbnb-option-3c1db0c7efb7).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Airbnb for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
